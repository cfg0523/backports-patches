backports-patches
=================

Working frag+ack, chan-qos-frag, and fix-negative-channel-1 patches for latest backports-patched in Arch Linux (available in AUR)

Place these patches in /etc/makepkg.d/backports-patched/patches/ so that the backports-patched installation picks these up and applies the patches as needed.
